# Data collection
- Bible books
- Images of popes

# Visualization
- Aggregate histograms:
    - Per old/new testament divide
    - Per book groupings divide (pentateuch, prophets, pauline letters, etc)
    - Per book
- Individual popes
    - Individual profiles based on divisions above
    - Column comparisong between old/new
        - faces, maybe on a timeline? two timelines one in left (old) one in right (new)
    - Time evolution of preferences
        - over time, each pope being assigned one preference
        - within a papacy
- We also have geographic information, so can visualize based on that!
- Speeched also have locations and languges, we can use that
    - a map of the world showing "biblical preferences" per country
    - same map, showing which popes (or how many) where in each country (also aggregate per region/continent)
- If we get demographic info of country (majority religion, % catholic, etc.), could use that.
